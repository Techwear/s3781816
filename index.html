						<!-- INTEREST IN IT -->
							<article id="2">
								<h2 class="major">INTEREST IN IT</h2>
					
								<b>What is your interest in IT?</b>
								<p>I have multiple interests in Information Technology, I’m interested in building Computers, Editing Photography and Videos and I’m interested in the management of data.</p>
								<b>When did your interest in IT start?</b>
								<p>My interest for building computers, editing videos/photos and data started throughout my years in high school. </p>
								<b>Was there an event or person that sparked your interest? </b>
								<p>My interest in building computers came from the time worked enough to purchase parts to build my own computer, the whole process of choosing parts and then putting it together is fun for me. Growing up and playing games, I watched a lot of montage edits on certain video games like Call of Duty. From that, I started editing my own montages which then lead to editing photos for myself and short films for school. My interest in data management sparked in my final units of Informatics when I spoke to my Uncle about it the topic who then suggested the path of working for businesses to manage/create their databases.</p>
								<b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </b>
								<p>I decided to come to RMIT because my family and friends that attend it all said how good the Campus, Technology and People are. Also, the Campus is easy to which is convenient. </p>
								<b>What do you expect to learn during your studies? </b>
								<p>During my studies I expect to learn about all the roles that Information Technology plays in the world and how I can get into the industry by learning the fundamentals of programming and technology. </p>

						<!-- IDEAL JOB -->
							<article id="3">
								<h2 class="major">IDEAL JOB</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/job.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The position is to work as a Database Administrator for Robert Half Technology’s Technical Services IT team and to be involved in technical support and maintenance of their IT Infrastructure, Databases and services. This is appealing to me because I would like to work for a company that is technology based that has a position available near Melbourne because it would be easy for me to get to. Also, data interests me so working as a Database Admin for a big company would be a good career goal. For the position, a big amount of skill is required. You must be able to problem solve issues across systems and database infrastructure, install, configure and maintain databases in technical server environments. For the position you must also have successful experience with Microsoft’s SQL, Amazon Web Services, troubleshooting and fixing database issues and scripting, automation in C#, HTML, PHP, VB,net and PowerShell. At the start of my first year in university I only have experience in fixing database issues, and I have started to learn HTML and software like SQL. I will obtain the skills necessary by completing my Bachelor of IT while picking more electives related to data analysation. From they I will work as a database analyst until I have possessed the skills necessary in problem solving, software related to data to become a database manager and from years of working I’ll work my way up to becoming a senior database manager. </p>

						<!-- PROJECT IDEA -->
							<article id="5">
								<h2 class="major">Moda Inventario</h2>
							    <b>Overview</b>
								<p>My project will be a phone application of that contains the inventory of your personal closet. The application will act as a personal database that would be built with many features. The app will be called ‘Moda Inventario’ which is Italian for ‘fashion inventory’. The app will let the users store profiles for their item and sort them out into categories such as; tops, pants, shoes and bags. Upon storing the item into their profile, users can add descriptions, images, photos and favourite them. Moda Inventario will also have a clean and minimalistic design to suit the environment of boldness. The app is targeted towards people that are into fashion that want to label their clothes to give them an idea of what they have or for just anyone that wants to organise their belongings. </p>
								 <b>Motivation</b>
								<p>The world’s clothing industry totals up to $2 trillion dollars and the shoe market is expected to reach $1 trillion dollars in 2019. This representation shows us the scale of clothing in everyday life and how we’re apart of it without even realising it. My project will be useful because it’ll give the people a lovely interface to organise their favourite pieces of clothes, shoes and accessories. The ability to have an inventory that you can access when you want is convenient for knowing what you own and for the ability of sharing your list with others if you please.</p>
								 <b>Description</b>
								<p>Moda Inventario will be an application that will be available on apple and android devices. The applications goal is to allow users to create a database that will aesthetically list of their clothes, shoes and accessories. Upon opening the app, the user will be asked to log in or sign up with an email. This will allow users to sync their data through multiple devices. Once the user logs in they will be able to see their inventory which would be empty if they’re a new user. They will be given the option to add an item which they can manually input the data for or search up depending on the popularity of the item. For one item the user can add a name, type, brand, price, description of size or the item, colour pallet and photos to the item. Upon adding an item, they can sort them out into multiple categories such as; season, colour, type of item (shoes, bags, pants), descending or ascending price order, favourites and custom folders. From each category, the user will be able to copy the details they want from item categories for their own purpose, an example is for selling items to a Facebook page or just for sharing with friends. Another function would be able to link your social medias to this application which would beneficial for people that are trying to view, sell, buy or trade items. The app would allow people to view folders that you allow them to see, so for example if a user wanted to show their shoe collection on Instagram, they can link the folder to the page which will allow users to view the inventory on the app. On the app you have the option to allow people to follow you and follow other people for inspiration. Being able to follow different kinds of people around the world can give inspiration for you and others to influence their own style. But if users would rather use Instagram for that kind of function, they can decide to use the app for just their organisational needs. They will even be able to use an offline mode which allows them to view and add items to their inventory but syncing to your online profile requires internet connection to save the data to the server. Moda Inventario targets users from fashion enthusiasts to people that just want to organise their belongings.  </p>
								 <b>Tools and Technologies</b>
								<p>To program the application a reliable computer that can run software such as XCode or Microsoft Visual Studio would be ideal. Both allow me to construct the user interface and write code in them. Having knowledge in code language such as C++, Swift, Java or Python will allow the me to create the application. Apart from having the knowledge of code equipment such as a keyboard, monitor and mouse is all I need to create the application.</p>
								 <b>Skills Required</b>
								<p>To create this project I must have the knowledge to code the application on developing software such as XCode or Microsoft Visual Studio. It easy to download developing software because they are normally free to the public. Learning to code the program will take time and practice but online tutorials are available online on YouTube and online forums.</p>
								 <b>Outcome</b>
								<p>The outcome of my project’s success means that people will have another application to share their interests on. The application fixes the problem of closet organisation and labelling. Moda Inventario will impact communities that are interested in fashion.</p>
